# Agriculture Leaf Vision

**Agriculture Leaf Vision** is a lightweight computer vision API that identifies plant species (or diseases) based on uploaded leaf images. It's built using **transfer learning** with CNN EfficientNetB2. I trained it on a PlantVillage dataset, and deployed to a serverless cloud backend.

> The project was developed to deepen my understanding of image preprocessing, transfer learning, and end-to-end ML deployment with minimal cloud cost. Originally deployed to Vertex the costs we to great for a side project.

## Try the App

**Live Demo:**  
https://agricultural-leaf-vision-7fab2.web.app/

You can upload a leaf image and receive a class prediction from the live API.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The model is **not trained to production quality** ‚Äî it often predicts the same label ("Pepper") for all inputs. It is intentionally undertrained to demonstrate infrastructure, not accuracy.

---

## What It Does

- Takes an uploaded image (leaf)
- Preprocesses the image to the correct input size
- Applies data augmentation during training
- Uses a pretrained CNN backbone (MobileNetV2 or EfficientNet)
- Fine-tunes the model on a small labeled dataset (PlantVillage)
- Returns class prediction via a REST API

## Model Evaluation

While the training curves suggest promising performance, the confusion matrix reveals signs of overfitting ‚Äî the model learned the training data well but fails to generalize to unseen examples.

### Confusion Matrix

üß† Note: The model shows high training accuracy and low loss, but the confusion matrix highlights that the classifier consistently mispredicts most classes ‚Äî suggesting the model is overfitting to a narrow subset of the training distribution.

## üß™ Preprocessing & Training Pipeline

To adapt a generic vision model to agricultural data I applied these techniques:

- **Image resizing and normalization** to match backbone input specs
- **Augmentation**: horizontal/vertical flips, zoom, rotation, contrast variation
- **Batching** with stratified shuffling
- Used **early stopping** and **learning rate scheduling**

> Full training from scratch was avoided. Transfer learning was sufficient given dataset size.

## Tech Stack

- **Python 3.10**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- `tf.keras.applications` (MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0)
- **Docker** (containerizing the API)
- **FastAPI** (optional REST layer)
- **Google Cloud Run** (serverless model hosting)
- **Artifact Registry** (image storage)
- **Firebase** (optional demo frontend)
- **Vite** (for future frontend deployment)

## Lessons Learned

- Observed how dataset quality directly impacts model output
- Evaluated tradeoffs between **model size** and **accuracy**
- **transfer learning** in a resource-constrained setting
- Built a **Dockerized ML inference API**
- Deployed with **Cloud Run** using minimal budget
- Fine-tuned image classification with **augmented data**
- Explored tradeoffs between **accuracy vs model size**
- Realized importance of **input resolution and normalization** for pre-trained CNNs

---

## Known Limitations

- The model is **not accurate** ‚Äî due to minimal training and limited dataset coverage
- It frequently predicts the same class ("Pepper") regardless of input
- Dataset coverage is limited to a few categories and model
- This project is **for educational/demo purposes only** and not suitable for real agricultural use
- Best results come from clear, close-up leaf images
